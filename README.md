# App Title: üê¢ Turtle Tokens üê¢ (MERN Stack Single-Page Application)
## Intro & Description :
 This application is meant for the user who is brand new to cryptocurrency. It is a resource for the user to learn the basics of crypto and get information on the most popular coins. In this time where everything is moving into a digital age, I believe that knowledge and action on these topics can help users to transition into the new financial system seemlessly. None of the information given is meant to give financial advice in anyway.

### Contribution Guidelines: 
 
 If you would like to contribute to the project you can push your code and create a pull request. Some areas of improvement to focus on would be the sign in feature, the graph iframe, and the youtube iframe. In the future I am looking to add a page for blog posts and a page for NFT's. I also would like to use a different crypto API and the youtube API as well.
